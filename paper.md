# Summary

BioPandas is a Python library that reads molecular structures from 3D-coordinate files, such as PDB (Bernstein *and others* 1977) and MOL2, into pandas DataFrames (McKinney 2010) for convenient data analysis and data mining related tasks.

In addition to parsing protein and small molecule data into a data frame format, BioPandas provides additional utility functions for structure analysis. These functions include common computations such as computing the root-mean-squared-deviation between structures and converting protein structures into primary amino acid sequence formats. 

Furthermore, useful small-molecule related functions are provided for reading and parsing millions of small molecule structures (from multi-MOL2 files) fast and efficiently in virtual screening applications. Inbuilt functions for filtering molecules by the presence of functional groups and their pair-wise distances to each other make BioPandas a particularly attractive utility library for virtual screening and protein-ligand docking applications.
